## Introduction

**Core Functions**:

 - Capacity detection
 - Automatic notification
 - Automatic lid opening
 - Automatic bag sealing

**Goal**:

 - Bring intelligence to outdoor trash cans at a low cost.

**Problems Solved**:

 - Cleaning staff must regularly check to make sure that the trash cans are not full.
   - Solved by **Capacity detection** and **Automatic notification**.
